Simplicial Developmental System 
Notes and stuffs

SDS is experimental software. It is free for non-commercial use. If
you are a non-commercial entity (eg. an individual) and you are not
charging for the artefacts (models or animations) you make with SDS, and the
artefacts have no other commercial purpose, then you can use SDS for
free. Otherwise, you will need to obtain a commercial license through an
agreement with the author.


Compilation Switches
====================

Defines:

DEBUG_LOG
	System generates a log as default.log. Contains transformation details and other bits and pieces. Only readable by ben! 

DEBUG_BINARY
	System dumps a LOT of information about binary io to stdout.

DEBUG_MEMORY
	System outputs constructor and destructor calls for some classes
	
Physical Model
==============

We use TPS to simulate the mechanical aspects of the growing shape. 
 
Assumptions
-----------
Density = 1 -- and therefore volume = mass
Mass of a cell = mass of a point particle at the center
Cells are perfectly spherical
The rest lengths of edges and volumes are determined by the sizes of the cells and WILL be changed DYNAMICALLY


TODO
----

* What other modules need to be notified if the mesh is modified?
- Collision
--- it may need to refine the coarseness of its space discretisation

* streamlined (Release) version of transformation code

* Set up license and dynamically link to external libraries where necessary
 
* Serialise oworld object, containing whatever it needs to serialise..?
